            <h2>About ML Strength</h2>
            <img class="left" src="images/about-us.jpg" alt="a photo of the ML Strength team">
            <aside class="about-aside"> We are a Brisbane based company with clubs at Ashgrove, Brisbane City, Chermside, Graceville and Westlake. ML Strength can offer cutting edge exercise options, including group fitness classes and one-on-one personal training sessions for weight loss, circuit training, boxing and karate. Our trainers are all Les Mills accredited instructors and are second to none â€“ all have Bachelor Degrees in Human Movements. We are a family operated business that has little to do with the rest of the fitness industry. Our gym world does not include the annoying telemarketers or membership consultants. Our gyms speak for themselves, our members do our marketing. We believe that word of mouth has way more credibility than something that a marketing machine dreams up. You are always welcome to look through any of our gyms at your own pace, with no pressure whatsoever. With hard-selling 'health club' sales consultants hustling you on every corner, we pride ourselves on being a refreshing change from that. Our 'no obligation, no pressure' attitude is clearly evident with our $10 CASUAL visit rate. We have created gyms that we would love to train in and share that passion and enthusiasm with our valued members. Our gyms have an old school feel with a new school attitude! </aside>
